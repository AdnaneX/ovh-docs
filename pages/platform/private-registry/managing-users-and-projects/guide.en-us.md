## Objective

OVHcloud Managed Private Registry service provides you a managed, authenticated Docker registry where you can privately store your Docker images. This guide will explain how to manage users and projects on your OVHcloud Managed Private Registry service.


## Requirements

- An OVHcloud Managed Private Registry (see the [creating a private registry](../creating-a-private-registry/) guide for more information)
- An access to the Harbor UI to operate the private registry (see the [connecting to the UI](../connecting-to-the-ui/) guide for more information)


## Instructions

You can manage projects, users and rights on your private registry by using the Harbor UI.

### Creating a new project

A project in Harbor contains all repositories of an application. No images can be pushed to Harbor before the project is created. 

There are two types of project in Harbor:

- Public: All users can read from a public Harbor project
- Private: Only users with proper privileges can read from this projects.

Let's create a private project:

1. Create a new project on Harbor UI

1. Call it *private* and leave the public checkbox unchecked

After the project is created, you can browse repositories, members, logs, replication and configuration using the navigation tab.

### Creating a new user and giving it rights on the *private* project


Now you're going to create a new user and give him developer rights over the *private* project.

1. Go to the *Users* section of Harbor UI and click on *New user*

1. Add a new *private-user* user. For the e-mail domain, use the domain found in the URL of your Harbor UI

    ![Managing users and projects](images/managing-users-and-projects-009.jpg){.thumbnail}


1. The new user is now visible in your Harbor UI

1. Go back to the *Project* section, choose the *private* project and in the *Members* tab, click on  *+User*

1. Add the *private-user* as member to the project, and give him a *Developer* role    

    ![Managing users and projects](images/managing-users-and-projects-012.jpg){.thumbnail}


The *private-user* is now a member of the *private* project.
