## Objective

By default, the Public Cloud projects as well as the resources total (RAM, CPU, disk space, number of instances, etc.) you can use are limited for security reasons.

To be able to use additional resources and projects, the quotas need to be increased.

**This guide explains how to request a Public Cloud quota increase in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**


## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia)
- a [valid payment method](../../billing/manage-payment-methods/) registered in your OVHcloud account
- you have exhausted the project quota of your OVHcloud account

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia) and switch to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section. Click on `Quota and Regions`{.action} in the left-hand sidebar.

This page provides an overview of regions and their available resources. A warning will be displayed next to a resource as soon as 80% of its current quota is reached.

Use the text field in the popup window to provide the following information:

- which quotas you would like to increase
- specific reasons for each resource increase, i.e. what the project and its instances will be used for (you can point out existing use cases as examples).

Once you have specified your need, click on `Confirm`{.action} Your request will be processed as soon as possible.
