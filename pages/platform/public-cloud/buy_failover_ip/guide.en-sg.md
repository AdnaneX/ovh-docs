>

## Objective

You may need to configure an Additional IP address on your instances for different reasons. For example, you may be:

- Hosting several websites on your instance.
- Hosting international projects.

To meet these needs, you can order an Additional IP address for your Public Cloud instances.

These Additional IP addresses can only be migrated to instances in the same project.

**This guide explains how to buy an Additional IP for an OVHcloud Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg){.external}
- A [Public Cloud instance](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/public-cloud/public-cloud-first-steps/) in your OVHcloud account.

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg) and open your `Public Cloud`{.action} project.
In the left-hand menu, click on `Additional IP`{.action} in the 'Network' section.

Then click on the `Actions`{.action} button and choose `Buy Cloud Additional IPs`{.action}.

Enter the following information:

- The number of Additional IPs you want to order (IP blocks are not currently available)
- The instance on which the IPs will be routed
- The location of the IPs

You will also need to accept the General Terms and Conditions of Service.

Each Additional IP will cost you â‚¬2 ex. VAT. They will then be renewed automatically and free of charge every month.

They are available in the following locations in Europe:
