> Since October 6th, 2022 our service "Failover IP" is named [Additional IP](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/network/additional-ip/). This has no further impact on any of its features or the functioning of your services.

## Objective

Being able to migrate IP addresses generally limits or removes the possibility that your service becomes unavailable. For example, you can effectively update a whole website to a new version or you can keep a replicated server active while running maintenance or installing updates on your production server.

**This guide explains how to migrate an Additional IP from one OVHcloud Public Cloud instance to another.**

## Prerequisites

- At least two [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- An Additional IP address
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg)

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> An Additional IP cannot be moved from one zone to another. For example, an IP located in the SBG data center can be moved to GRA or RBX, but cannot be moved to BHS.
>

First, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg) and open your `Public Cloud`{.action} project. Then, select Additional IP in the **Network** section.

In our example, an Additional IP is routed to "Instance_A" and we want to redirect it towards "Instance_B".

Choose the destination server from the list by clicking the checkbox.

Confirm by clicking on `Attach`{.action}.

After a few seconds the Control Panel will be updated and a confirmation message will be displayed if the migration was done sucessfully.

The Additional IP can be configured on the destination server before or after carrying out the migration. If it was preconfigured, it will begin to respond as soon as the routing operation is completed.
