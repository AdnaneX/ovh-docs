## Objective

AI Deploy allows you to deploy AI apps or models. To test or use the product, you can build on existing AI models.

For example, you can rely on **open-source** models or apps.

## Portfolio of AI apps and models

Below are examples of existing models that can be deployed with **AI Deploy**. However, you are free to deploy any other AI model or app of your choice.

### YOLO

**YOLO** ('You only look once'), is an `Object Detection` algorithms family.

*References:*

- YOLOv5 [repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
- YOLOv7 [repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
- Access and load YOLOv5 trained models from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/ultralytics_yolov5/)

### DALL-E mini

**DALL-E mini** is an AI model that can draw images from any text prompt (`Text-to-Image`).

*References:*

- DALL-E mini [repository](https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini)
- Test DALL-E mini on this [website](https://www.craiyon.com/)
- Access DALL-E mini model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini)

### Stable Diffusion

**Stable Diffusion** is `Text-to-Image` model that generates images from text.

*References:*

- Stable Diffusion [repository](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
- Stable Diffusion [website](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release)
- Access Stable Diffusion model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)

### EfficientNet

**EfficientNet** is a family of `Image Classification` models. There are eight different EfficientNet models (`b0` -> `b7`)

*References:*

- Access and load EfficientNet model from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_efficientnet/)

### ResNet

**ResNet** are AI models based residual neural network whose aim is to solve `Image Classification` tasks.

*References:*

- Access and load ResNet models from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/)

### MobileNet V2

**MobileNet** are `Computer Vision` models designed to be used in mobile applications. They are known for their small size and low latency.

*References:*

- Access and load ResNet models from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/)

### GPT-2

**GPT-2** is a `Text Generation` model developed by Open AI.

*References:*

- Find more information about GPT-2 [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2)
- Access GPT-2 model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/gpt2)

### BERT

Famous NLP models based on **BERT** can also be deployed for `Text Classification` for example.

*References:*

- Access BERT-based models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bert)

### BART

**BART**-based models can also be deployed for `Zero-Shot Classification` tasks.

*References:*

- Access BART-based models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bart)

## Go further

You can also refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ovh/ai-training-examples) to find examples of AI apps to deploy.

> [!primary]
>
> You will find all the **codes** and **documentation** needed to deploy each app [here](https://docs.ovh.com/es/publiccloud/ai/).
>

Here are some examples of AI apps we propose:

- Deploy an app for audio classification task using Streamlit
- Deploy a web service for YOLOv5 using Flask
- Deploy a Gradio app for sketch recognition
- Deploy an app for sentiment analysis with Hugging Face models using Flask
- Deploy an interactive app for EDA and prediction using Streamlit
