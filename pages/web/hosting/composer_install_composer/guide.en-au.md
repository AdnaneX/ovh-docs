## Objective

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/){.external} is a dependency manager created for the PHP language. It allows PHP developers to include external libraries in their programmes. Composer allows PHP projects to simplify library distribution and code maintenance. Since the creation of this tool, many good development practices have been proposed and have improved the libraries of the PHP community. These good practices are documented in the form of [SRP](http://www.php-fig.org/){.external}.

**This guide explains how to install Composer and provides an example of usage with a Web Hosting plan.**

> [!warning]
>This guide will show you how to use one or more OVHcloud solutions with external tools, and will describe the actions to be carried out in a specific context. Please remember to adapt these actions to fit your situation.
>
If you encounter any difficulties performing these actions, please contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-au/directory/) and/or discuss the issue with our community on https://community.ovh.com/en/. OVHcloud cannot provide you with technical support in this regard.

## Requirements

- an [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/) with SSH access
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au)

## Instructions

Use the command line to check if the PHP version is compatible:


```bash
php --version
```

If this is not a proper version, you can configure an alias:


```bash
alias php='/usr/local/php8.0/bin/php'
```

We recommend staying in the root folder of your Web Hosting in order to prevent your Composer files from being publicly accessible. Run this command next to install Composer:


```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Composer is now available on your Web Hosting.


### Use cases

For example, if you want to install Symfony 2 in a simple way, you can run the following command:

```bash
php composer.phar create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition my_project_name "2.7.*"
```

Similarly, you can use the OVHcloud API from your Web Hosting by using the official wrapper. To do this, simply add a file named `composer.json` that contains the list of dependencies you need. Here is an example of this file with the OVHcloud API wrapper:


```json
1. {
2.     "name": "Example Application",
3.     "description": "This is an example of OVH APIs wrapper usage",
4.     "require": {
5.         "ovh/ovh": "1.1.*"
6.     }
7. }
```

To install it, simply run the following command in the same folder:

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

To use this library, you can refer to the documentation, as well as the code, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ovh/php-ovh){.external}.
