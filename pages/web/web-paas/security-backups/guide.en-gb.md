## Objective  

Backups vary by our offering and their retention is governed by our [data retention](../security-data-retention). This section details our Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for our Web PaaS Professional and Web PaaS Enterprise offerings.

## Web PaaS Professional

With Web PaaS Professional, we have enabled our clients to manage their own backup and restore functions. Please see the [backup and restore](../administration-backup-and-restore) page for details.

**RPO**: User defined. The RPO is configured by our clients.

**RTO**: Variable. Recovery time will depend upon the size of the data we are recovering
