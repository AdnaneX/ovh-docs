## Objective  

We ensure Customer data is protected by limiting internal access and preventing unauthorized access by implementing security measures such as encryption of data in transport and at rest. We only access data internally for support reasons at the Customer's request, or to fix or prevent an outage. Additionally, we maintain a list of Web PaaS employees with access to customer data, which is reviewed monthly.   

## Data Disclosure

We do not disclose Customer data to third parties unless legally obligated to do so under certain circumstances such as a law enforcement request.
