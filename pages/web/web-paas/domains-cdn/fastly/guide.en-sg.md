## Objective  

In some cases you may want to opt to use a CDN such as Fastly rather than the Web PaaS router's cache.  Using a CDN can offer a better time-to-first-byte for cached content across a wider geographic region at the cost of the CDN service.


A Fastly CDN is included for Web PaaS Dedicated instances.  Web PaaS does not offer an integrated CDN on self-service Grid projects at this time, but it is a common choice for customers to self-configure.

Launching a Web PaaS site with Fastly in front of it is nearly the same as launching normally.  There are only a few notable differences. Individual applications may have their own Fastly setup instructions or additional modules. Consult the documentation for your application for specific details.

## Set the Web PaaS domain on Fastly

Rather than create a DNS CNAME for your Web PaaS master branch (for instance `master-7rqtwti-qwertyqwerty.eu.platform.sh`), [configure Fastly](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/basic-configuration/working-with-domains) to respond to requests for your domain name and to treat the Web PaaS master branch as its backend server.  Be sure to enable TLS for the backend connection to Web PaaS.  Then configure your DNS to point your domain at Fastly instead.  See the [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/basic-configuration/connecting-to-origins) for further details.

## HTTP Redirect

From the Fastly interface under "Configure", edit the configuration for your origin to enable the ["Force TLS and enable HSTS"](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/enabling-hsts-through-fastly).

Generally, Web PaaS recommends specifying only HTTPS routes in your `routes.yaml` file. This results in all pages being served over SSL and any requests for an HTTP URL automatically redirected to HTTPS. When Fastly has been added as an intermediary to your project, however, this automatic redirect fails. Once a user visits your site with an HTTP request and is directed to Fastly, Fastly continues to query Web PaaS using HTTPS (since that is how origin has been configured), resulting in Web PaaS never detecting the HTTP request in the first place. Enabling the "Force TLS and enable HSTS" option will cause Fastly to do the same HTTP to HTTPS redirect as Web PaaS, ensuring that all requests are over HTTPS end-to-end.

## DNS TXT records

If using the Fastly CDN that is included with a Web PaaS Enterprise subscription, You will need to obtain a DNS TXT record from your Customer Support Engineer prior to going live.  You will need to enter that as a DNS TXT record with your domain registrar.  This step should be done well in advance of the actual go-live.

## Anycast

You have the option of using either a [CNAME or a set of Anycast IP addresses](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/basic-configuration/using-fastly-with-apex-domains).  Fastly prefers that you use the CNAME but either work.  If using the Anycast IP addresses on a Dedicated production environment, open a support ticket with the new A records to provide to our support team.
