## Objective  

Web PaaS provides a web management console so you can interact with your projects and manage your environments.

![Overview of projects in the console](images/all-projects.png "0.5")

This console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](../../development/cli/_index.md).

## Project list

The [main console page](https://console.platform.sh) gives you an overview of all your projects.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects or choosing a specific organization from the menu.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](./configure-project.md).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](./configure-environment.md).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.
