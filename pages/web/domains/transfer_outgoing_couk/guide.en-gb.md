## Objective

Domain transfer refers to the process of moving a registered domain name from one registrar to another. For example, if you have ordered a domain name on our website, OVHcloud is its current registrar. An outgoing domain transfer needs to be initiated by changing **TAG** for the domain. 

This guide reffer to transfer all .uk domains: .co.uk, .gov.uk, .me.uk., etc.

This guide explains how to prepare your domain name for an outgoing transfer.

## Requirements

- a [domain name](https://www.ovh.co.uk/domains/) registered with OVHcloud
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) with the necessary permissions to manage the domain name (domain administrator)
- domain name must not be under ongoing disupute with Nominet


## Intructions

### Step 1: Check your future registrar transfer TAG

In order to transfer your domain to another registrar, you must first specify your future provider transfer TAG. You can contact your future provider directly to obtain this **TAG** which will be recommended, as you can also check transfer process with new provider as this may vary between different registrars.

The list of TAGs for the different registrars is also available on the official [Nominet](http://www.nominet.uk/registrar-list){.external} registry website.

### Step 2: Change your domain TAG

Log in to your [OVHcloud control panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) and go to `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. Click `Domains`{.action} and chose your domains from the list. 

On the `General information`{.action} tab you can find the "Protection against domain name transfer" slider button under **Security**, set to `Not available`{.action} by default.

If for whatever reason you cannot modify your domain's TAG in your control panel, you can ask Nominet to modify it for you. 

Go to this page on the Registry's website: [Manage your domain - Change registrar](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/manage-your-domain/change-registrar).
Please note, you will be charged for this service.


## Step 3: Pass the information on to your new domain name provider
