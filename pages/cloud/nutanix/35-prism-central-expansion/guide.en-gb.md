## Objectif

**This guide will show you how to redeploy Prism-Central in X-LARGE mode across three virtual machines.**


> [!warning]
> This tutorial will show you how to use one or more OVHcloud solutions with external tools, and will describe the actions to be carried out in a specific context. You may need to adapt the instructions according to your situation.
>
> If you encounter any difficulties performing these actions, please contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/) and/or discuss the issue with our community. You can find more information in the [Go further](#gofurther) section of this tutorial.

## Requirements

- A Nutanix cluster in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)
- You must be connected to the cluster via Prism Central
- Know the Prism Element admin password (When deploying a Nutanix cluster by OVHcloud this password is created in the same way as Prism Central but can be changed later).

## Overview

You can deploy Prism Central in a custom sizing with these options:

- Small with 6 26Gb vCPUs of memory and 500Gb of storage per virtual machine.
- Large with 10 vCPU, 44 GB of memory and 2500 GB of storage per virtual machine.
- X-Large with 14 vCPU, 60Gb of memory and 2500Gb of storage per virtual machine.

The default deployment of Prism Central on Nutanix by OVHcloud is on a single virtual machine in *Small* mode.

The Prism Central redeployment mode on Nutanix clusters by OVHcloud is *Small* with one or three virtual machines.

## Instructions

We will look at how to replace Prism Central in Small mode on a single virtual machine with a Prism Central in X-Large mode and then extend Prism Central on 3 virtual machines for more resilience.

> [!warning]
> Replacing the operating mode of Prism Central means removing Prism Central and all options managed by Prism Central (Microsegmentation, Disaster recovery, etc...).

```

### Replacing the Prism Central virtual machine with an X-Large machine

Run these commands after you have modified this information:

* **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central
* **\<Prism-Element-Admin-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password
* **\<Prism-Central-VM-Name\>** : Prism Central VM name

```bash
# Disconnect Prism Element in Prism Central
ncli multicluster remove-from-multicluster external-ip-address-or-svm-ips=<Prism-Central-Private-IP-address> username=admin password=<Prism-Element-Admin-Password> force=true
# Delete VM
acli vm.delete <Prism-Central-VM-Name>
```

Next, connect to an AHV host in the cluster with this command.

```bash
ssh root@private-ip-address-of-one-ahv-servers
```

Run this command to retrieve the UUID of your default storage having modified these settings:

* **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
* **\<Prism-Element-IP\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X GET "https://<Prism-Element-Ip>:9440/PrismGateway/services/rest/v2.0/storage_containers/" | jq -r '[.entities[] | select( .name | contains("default-container")) | .storage_container_uuid][0]'
```

Next, run this other command to retrieve the UUID of your clusterâ€™s administration network, with the same elements that need to be modified as the previous command:

```bash
curl -s -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST https://<prism6element-IP>:9440/api/nutanix/v3/subnets/list -d {} | jq -r "[.entities[] | select( .spec.name | contains(\"<subnet name>\")) | .metadata.uuid][0]"
```

Create a file named **PrismCentralXlarge.json** with the information below :

```json
{
    "resources": {
        "version": "pc.2022.6.0.1",
        "should_auto_register": false,
        "initial_password": "<Prism-Central-Password>",
        "pc_vm_list": [
            {
                "vm_name": "prism-central",
                "container_uuid": "<Default-Container-UUID>",
                "num_sockets": 14,
                "data_disk_size_bytes": 2684354560000,
                "memory_size_bytes": 64424509440,
                "nic_list": [
                    {
                        "ip_list": [
                            "<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address>"
                        ],
                        "network_configuration": {
                            "network_uuid": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-UUID>",
                            "subnet_mask": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-mask>",
                            "default_gateway": "<Nutanix-Network-Admin-Gateway>"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Replace these items in the file :

* **\<Prism-Central-Password\>** : Password for the future Prism Central virtual machine.
* **\<Default-Container-UUID\>** : UUID of the default storage retrieved earlier.
* **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central.
* **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-UUID\>** : Nutanix Cluster Administration Network UUID.
* **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-mask\>** : Nutanix cluster administration network subnet mask.
* **\<Nutanix-Network-Admin-Gateway\>** : Nutanix cluster administration network default gateway.


Run this command to deploy your Prism Central virtual machine in X-Large mode by changing these settings :

* **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
* **\<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST "https://<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address>:9440/api/nutanix/v3/prism_central" -d @PrismCentralXlarge.json
```

> [!warning]
> Wait thirty minutes for this virtual machine to deploy.
>

Enter this command by editing these options to create a **pcregister.json** file.

* **\<Prism-Central-Password\>** : Prism Central Password.
* **\<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Central.

```bash
echo "{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"<Prism-Central-Password>\",\"port\":9440,\"ipAddresses\":[\"<Prism-Central-Private-IP-Address>\"]}" > pcregister.json
```

Run this command to save Prism Element to your new Prism Central virtual machine by changing these settings :

* **\<Prism-Element-Password\>** : Prism Element admin account password.
* **\<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address\>** : Private IP address of Prism Element.

```bash
curl -k -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json -u "admin:<Prism-Element-Password>" -X POST "https://<Prism-Element-Private-IP-Address>:9440/PrismGateway/services/rest/v1/multicluster/prism_central/register" -d @pcregister.json
```

Prism Element is now saved in the new Prism Central.

### Migration of Prism Central to 3 virtual machines

Now that Prism Element is attached to your Prism Central virtual machine we will connect to Prism Central and extend Prism Central to three virtual machines.
