## Objective

**This page provides an overview of the lifecycle policy of OVHcloud Hosted Private Cloud powered by Nutanix services.**

OVHcloud's Hosted Private Cloud powered by Nutanix service proposes dedicated infrastructure based on Nutanix's technologies.

OVHcloud has a lifecycle policy for the service in order to take into account several factors, such as:

* the lifecycle policy of integrated software components as determined by Nutanix;
* the lifecycle of the hardware components;
* the compatibility between hardware and/or software components;
* any factor affecting the quality of the service.

This lifecycle policy is provided to help clients understand the underlying reasons for version or range changes and the impact of each phase of the lifecycle on the service, and anticipate and prepare the transition to a newer version or range.

### Commercial range concerned
