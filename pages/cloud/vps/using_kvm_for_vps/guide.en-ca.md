## Objective

The KVM console allows you to connect directly to your VPS without the need to use external software such as Terminal or PuTTY. This console is accessible via your OVHcloud Control Panel or the OVHcloud API.  

**This guide explains both of the KVM access methods.**

## Requirements

- a [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/vps/) in your OVHcloud account
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca)

## Instructions

### Connecting to the KVM via the OVHcloud Control Panel

#### With a current VPS range

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca), go to the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section and select your server from the list in the left-hand navigation under `Virtual Private Servers`{.action}. In this section, click on `...`{.action} next to the name of your VPS in the "Your VPS" box.

#### With older VPS ranges

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca), go to the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section and select your server from the list in the left-hand navigation under `Virtual Private Servers`{.action}. In this section, click on the shortcut link labelled `KVM`{.action}.

### Using the KVM console

The KVM screen will now open, which is a small window showing a connection to your server. Since the window is rather small it will be quite difficult to navigate around your server's interface using the scrollbars. Therefore we recommend that you open the KVM in a new, full-screen window using the "Open in a new window" button in the bottom right corner of the popup.

> If you have issues with double typing, the issue may originate due to auto screen adjustment. We recommend opening the KVM in a new window using the "Open in a new window" button.
>
> Should you still have issues with the screen, we recommend removing from the URL the "auto" part. If the URL is https://compute.sbg1.cloud.ovh.net:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=xxxxxxxxxxxx then it should become https://compute.sbg1.cloud.ovh.net:6080/vnc.html?token=xxxxxxxxxxxx (the link for you may be different, this is only illustrating which part of the URL needs to be removed)

### Connecting to the KVM via the APIs

You may sometimes experience issues connecting to the KVM via your OVHcloud Control Panel, especially with older versions. In this case, you can use the API solution. To do this, log in via the [OVHcloud API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/).

#### For a 2014 VPS

If you have a 2014 VPS, you may encounter *error 1006*. Going through the API using the call below could resolve this.

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /vps/{serviceName}/openConsoleAccess
>
> API call parameters:
>
>> serviceName *
>>> ID of your VPS which looks something like vpsxxxxx.ovh.net
>> protocol
>>> VNC

Despite the command going through on the API, the connection might take one or two minutes â€“ the time it takes for the port to be successfully opened.

We recommend using either of the following clients:

- [UltraVnc](https://www.uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc.html){.external}
- [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/){.external}

Use the details provided by the API call to connect to the VPS remotely using either of the above-mentioned software clients.

#### For a 2016 VPS

If problems arise with the KVM, here is the recommended API for accessing the KVM:

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /vps/{serviceName}/getConsoleUrl
>
> API call parameters:
>
>> serviceName *
>>> ID of your VPS which looks something like vpsxxxxx.ovh.net
>

> [!primary]
>
> Should you still have issues with the screen, we recommend removing from the URL the "auto" part. If the URL is (the link for you may be different, this is only illustrating which part of the URL needs to be removed) https://compute.sbg1.cloud.ovh.net:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=xxxxxxxxxxxx then it should become https://compute.sbg1.cloud.ovh.net:6080/vnc.html?token=xxxxxxxxxxxx
