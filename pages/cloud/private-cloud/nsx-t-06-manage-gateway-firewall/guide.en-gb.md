## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)
- Having **NSX-T** deployed with one segment configured in your NSX-T configuration, you can use this guide [Segment management in NSX-T](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/private-cloud/nsx-t-segment-management).

# Overview

Gateway Firewall allows filtering between internal segments and the network outside the incoming or outgoing cluster.

It works on the North-South (Tier-0 Gateways) and East-West (Tier-1 Gateways) gateways if the source or destination is not inside the cluster.

If you want to create filtering rules between internal segments, you will need to use distributed firewall using this guide [Distributed Firewall Management](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/nsx-t-manage-distributed-firewall).

## Instructions

We will create a strategy to improve the visibility and administration of rules based on their usefulness.

Next, we will add a rule within our strategy that blocks access to the entire external network of a cluster from a group that contains a segment (you can use this guide to create groups [Distributed Firewall Management](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/nsx-t-manage-distributed-firewall)) and **any** for the destination.

Go to the `Security`{.action} tab, select `Gateway Firewall`{.action} and click `+ ADD POLICY`{.action}.

Choose `Drop`{.action} under the **Action** column and click `PUBLISH`{.action}.

![01 Create gateway firewall rules 07](images/01-create-gateway-firewall-rules07.png){.thumbnail}

Your rule is active on the gateway **ovh-T0-gw** it blocks all outgoing traffic from members of the group **g-segment01**.
