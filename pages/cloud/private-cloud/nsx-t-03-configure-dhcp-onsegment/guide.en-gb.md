## Pr√©requis

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials.
- Having a user account with access to vSphere as well as the specific rights for NSX-T (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we))
- You need to have **NSX-T** deployed with a segment configured in your NSX-T configuration. Use this guide [Segment management in NSX-T](https://docs.ovh.com/en/us/private-cloud/nsx-t-segment-management).

## Instructions

We will configure a DHCP server on a segment connected to **OVH-T1-gw**. This segment is configured with a gateway in **192.168.1.254/24**.

From the NSX-T interface go to the `Networking`{.action} tab and click on `Segments`{.action} on the left.

Choose this information :

* **Name** : Name of your DHCP server.
* **Server IP Address** : The IP address of your DHCP server, which must not be the same as your gateway IP address in this form 192.168.1.253/24.
* **Edge Cluster** : Select your cluster edge.

And click `Save`{.action}.

![01 add DHCP ON Segment 05](images/01-add-dhcp-on-segment05.png)

Enter these values:

* **DHCP Server Address**: DHCP server address 192.168.1.253/24 (This must be the same address as in the DHCP profile).
* **DHCP Range**: Scope of your DHCP server with the beginning and ending address separated by a dash 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.200.
* **DNS Server**: OVHcloud DNS Server 213.186.33.99.

Then click `APPLY`{.action}.
