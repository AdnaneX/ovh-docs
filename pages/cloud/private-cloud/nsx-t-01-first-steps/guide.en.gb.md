**This guide is an introduction to the NSX-T**

NSX-T is a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** solution provided by VMware. OVHcloud is offering this service to replace NSX-V in its Hosted Private Cloud Powerer by VMware solution.

When a customer subscribes to the NSX-T offer and is enabled, a preset is applied with two gateways :

- **Tier-0 Gateway** : For connections between the cluster and the public INTERNET network, known as north-south traffic.
- **Tier-1 Gateway**: For communication between cluster virtual segments. This type of connection is called east-west traffic.

The two gateways are interconnected to allow internal networks to communicate outside the cluster.

OVHcloud provides a block of 16 public IP addresses, some of which are reserved. You can use 8 addresses from the second address in the block to perform port redirections.

## Requirements

- Being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- A user account with access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)


## Instructions

### Logging in to the NSX-T administration interface

You can connect to NSX-T from the URL of your cluster, provided by OVHcloud, in the form **https://pcc-xxxxx.ovh.xx**.

From the homepage for your cluster, click the `NSX NSX-T`{.action} icon.

A diagram representing the network topology is available with two public IP addresses (both addresses are for NSX-T and are not usable for port redirections) connected to the **ovh-T0-gateway** and the connection to the **ovh-T1-gateway**.
