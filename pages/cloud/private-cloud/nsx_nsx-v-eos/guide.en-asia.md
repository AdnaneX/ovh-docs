## Objective

The NSX-v component will no longer be maintained by VMware as of January 15, 2024. This guide helps you analysing your use of NSX-v features and therefore offers you different evolution scenarios: from disabling the NSX-v component to migrating to its successor NSX-T (named NSX by VMware since version 4.0).

## Instructions

### Identifying your NSX-v usage

To identify your usage of the NSX-v feature in your Hosted Private Cloud environment, you have to ask yourself the following questions:

- Am I using VXLAN?
- Am I using a Distributed Firewall rules?
- Am I using a Distributed Logical Router?
- Am I using an Edge Services Gateway?
- Am I using an SSL VPN?

#### I do not use any of the NSX-v features

If you do not use any of the above features, you will be able to deactivate NSX-v. You will be notified when the deactivation process is available.

#### I only use VXLAN

If the only feature you use is VXLAN, you have the following choice:

- Migrating to NSX (see [details](#migration) below),
- Reconfiguring your network in order to replace VXLAN with [VLAN](/pages/cloud/private-cloud/creation_vlan).
  
If you wish to migrate to VLAN, to help you to configure your network, you can use this API call to generate a mapping between VXLAN to VLAN.
> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/generateVxlanToVrackMapping
>

> **Parameters:**
>
> serviceName: the reference for your PCC as `pcc-XX-XX-XX-XX`.

> [!primary]
>
>  Find more information on the OVHcloud API in our guide on [Getting started with the OVHcloud API](/pages/account/api/first-steps).

To create your VLAN networks, you can follow this documentation: [VLAN Creation](/pages/cloud/private-cloud/creation_vlan)

You will then have to deactivate NSX-v. You will be notified when the deactivation process is available.

#### I use some of the NSX-v features

We recommend migrating to NSX (see [details](#migration) below) to benefit from all its included features.

Alternatively, you can decide to deploy alternatives components (Load-balancer, Firewall appliance, VPN, ...) and then disable NSX-v (you will be notified when the deactivation process is available).

### Migrating to NSX <a name="migration"></a>

The NSX software is enabled at the Virtual Datacenter (vDC) level. In order to migrate from NSX-v to NSX, you can order a new vDC for your existing Hosted Private Cloud service (feature available starting July 18, 2023), add new Hosts and then migrate from your current vDC to the new vDC using VMware vMotion.

The documentation to migrate to NSX is not yet available. 

Our support teams and [Professional Services experts](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/professional-services/) can provide you with assistance when the migration is available.
