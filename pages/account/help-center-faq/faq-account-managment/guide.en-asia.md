Find the most frequently asked questions about managing your OVHcloud account


### How do I create an OVHcloud account?

Creating an account is free and simple. Your account is designed to give you easy access to your information, and help you manage your services. To create an account, [click here](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia).

You can also secure access to your personal information by enabling two-factor authentication. You can do this by going to "My account", then "Security". For further information on how to keep your account secure, read the "How do I secure my account?" section below.

#### Tips and tricks

You can’t find your country? Change the website language by clicking on the flag of your choice in the top right-hand corner.

### Where can I find my OVHcloud username?

Your username or customer ID — also called a NIC handle — is located in the top right-hand corner of your last invoice. It looks like this: “ab00001-ovh” (the first letters are normally the initials of the person who created the account). This username is also included in all emails sent by OVHcloud (account creation confirmation email, order confirmations, renewal emails, etc.).

If you have not yet found your username, you can click on the “Forgotten your username or password?” link on the login page for your [OVHcloud account](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/asia/&ovhSubsidiary=asia), and enter the email address associated with your account.

#### Tips and tricks

When you are logged into the OVHcloud Control Panel, you will find your username in the top right-hand corner, next to your name.

### What do I do if I can't log in to my customer account?

For various reasons — such as forgetting your password, losing access to your email address, or to your mobile phone for an SMS identification — you may not be able to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel.
If this happens to you, please follow this guide, which is designed for resolving situations like this:

Next, go to the “My profile” section of this page.

#### Tips and tricks

Want to change the email address for your OVHcloud account? A confirmation request will first be sent to the email address you currently have listed in the OVHcloud Control Panel. If you can no longer access this email address, you will need to wait 24 hours. After this period, the change will automatically be made.

### How do I add my telephone number correctly on my account?

Your telephone number needs to be entered in its international format.

### Tips and tricks

For "07123456789", please enter "+44 7123456789". The "+44" is automatically added if you select United Kingdom as your country of residence.

### How do I change my OVHcloud password?

Go to the OVHcloud Control Panel login page, and click “Forgotten your username or password?”. Enter the username or primary email address linked to your OVHcloud account, then click “Send”. A confirmation email will be sent to the contact email address. Please read the instructions carefully, and click on the link in the email.

#### Tips and tricks

If you can no longer access the contact email address, please follow this [procedure](https://www.ovh.com/asia/support/procedures/).
If you have forgotten your username, you can find it in the top right-hand corner of your last invoice. It is sometimes referred to as a NIC handle, and resembles the following: “ab00001-ovh”. (the first letters are normally the initials of the person who created the account). This username is also provided in the confirmation email when you create your account, as well as in emails confirming or renewing an order.

### How do I change contacts?

You can delegate the administrative, technical and billing management of your services to other OVHcloud customer accounts from the OVHcloud Control Panel. To do this, go to the “Contact management” section, accessible from the banner on the right.

The service delegation must be validated via email both by the service administrator and the new contact.

Before you make any changes, please ensure that all contact email addresses are valid, otherwise the request will not be successful.

If you would like to retrieve a domain name that you are the registered owner of from the registry (you can check this information on [www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/tools/check_whois.pl](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/tools/check_whois.pl)), but you do not have access to the administrator customer account, please follow this procedure: [www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/procedure/procedureChangeContacts.cgi](https://www.ovh.co.uk/cgi-bin/procedure/procedureChangeContacts.cgi)

#### Tips and tricks

### How do I set and change a billing contact?

### How do I secure my account?

You can choose from several solutions to secure your account, such as:

    choosing a complex password
    regular renewal
    two-factor authentication

For two-factor authentication by sending a code via SMS or through IP restriction (authorisation or refusal of access to certain addresses), you can add security rules from your Control Panel. These options are all available in the “Security” section, after clicking on your initials in the top right-hand corner of the OVHcloud Control Panel Dashboard.
