## Objective

This guide explains how to provide a user with the minimum rights to allow her/him to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel.

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud account](/pages/account/customer/ovhcloud-account-creation)
- Knowing [how to manage account users](/pages/account/customer/ovhcloud-users-management)
- Knowing [how to set up policies for IAM](/pages/account/iam-policies-ui)

## Instructions

To be able to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel, a user should have at least this minimum set of rights on the account resource:

- account:apiovh:me/get
- account:apiovh:me/supportLevel/get
- account:apiovh:me/certificates/get
- account:apiovh:me/tag/get

With these rights, a user will be able to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel. To be able to perform any actions inside the Control Panel however, additional rights have to be assigned through IAM.

### Using UI

Using the UI, you can set up a policy with the following configuration:

- Add a `resourceType` "My account".
- Add your account as a resource.
- Add the 4 rights listed above as an action.

You can now link your users to this policy to give them the right to log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel.

### Using API

Using the API, you can set up a policy according to the following example:

```json
{
  "name": "manager_ro",
  "description": "manager_ro",
  "identities": [
    .... 
  ],
  "resources": [ 
     {
         "urn": "urn:v1:eu:resource:account:xx1111-ovh" 
     }],
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      {
        "action": "account:apiovh:me/get"
      },
      {
        "action": "account:apiovh:me/supportLevel/get"
      },
      {
        "action": "account:apiovh:me/certificates/get"
      },
      {
        "action": "account:apiovh:me/tag/get"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
